PicturedRocks is a python package that implements some single cell analysis algorithms that we are studying. Currently, we implement two marker selection algorithms:

1. 1-bit Compressed Sensing algorithms based on [Conrad, et al. BMC bioinformatics '17]
2. variants of mutual information based algorithms (e.g., the "minimum Redundance Maximum Relevance" algorithm [Peng, et al. IEEE TPAMI '05])

## Usage

To install the latest GitHub version of PicturedRocks, do an "editable" installation of PicturedRocks:
```
git clone git@github.com:umangv/picturedrocks.git
cd picturedrocks
pip install -e .
```

PicturedRocks in compatible with `scanpy` and uses its `AnnData` objects. Most methods require cluster labels to be loaded. 

```python
from picturedrocks.read import read_clusts, process_clusts
adata = read_clusts(adata, "clust_labels.csv")
adata = process_clusts(adata)
```

More detailed information can be found on the [online documentation](https://picturedrocks.rtfd.io/).
